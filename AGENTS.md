# AGENTS.md

This repository is a fork of the original Giri project, an implementation of the dynamic backwards code slicing algorithm for the LLVM compiler.
The issue addressed by this repository is that the original Giri program is targeted towards LLVM version 3.4 and works only if itself, as well as the source code that it is run on, is compiled using tools from the LLVM suite of this exact version.
The overall task of this repository is to provide ports of the program for some versions X, present in associated git branches `port/llvm-X`.

Every version branch (`port/llvm-*`) carries a copy of this file and may append a `## Current state` section at the top with branch-specific status.

## Current state

As of `3b26ea6` (2026-08-12), `port/llvm-5.0.2` builds cleanly with CMake against the prebuilt
LLVM/Clang 5.0.2 toolchain and the suite reports 21 of 22 tests passing. The port itself
(`porting/TaskNotes/Tasks/llvm-5-port.md`) and the full-suite audit (`llvm-5-test-audit`, reports
under `porting/TestAudit/llvm-5.0.2/`) are done, and the two defects the audit found are fixed
(`llvm-5-test-fixes`): the rewritten `PostDominanceFrontier::calculate` returned before recursing
into its children at the post-dominator tree's virtual root, which emptied the frontier map for
every function with multiple exits (10 tests), and `findAllStoresForLoad` passed an instruction ID
where `findNextNestedID` expects a basic-block ID (test16). Three things remain open:
`matrix_multiply` still fails in the sequential configuration the suite actually runs
(`Dockerfile` sets `TEST_PARALLELISM=seq`, but the audit examined the *pthread* variants of
`matrix_multiply`, `pca` and `kmeans`, so no seq variant has ever been audited); `kmeans` is scored
PASS by a harness that discards stderr and ignores the traced binary's exit status, while its
pthread variant aborts on a CPU-count assertion and writes a 108 GB trace; and the port's
verification debt — the three invariants below were never explicitly
checked — is unclosed. The open task notes in `porting/TaskNotes/Tasks/`, in the order they should
be worked, are `llvm-5-harness-honesty`, `llvm-5-seq-variant-failures`, `llvm-5-kmeans` and
`llvm-5-port-closeout`. (`porting/llvm-releases/5.0.0/api-breakings.yaml`
is triaged for only 4 of its 388 entries; finishing it is deliberately deferred.)

## Containers — two kinds

There are **two** containers in this workflow:

1. **Agent devcontainer** — the workspace where this agent runs, where source code lives, and where `driver.py` is invoked. This is your shell.
2. **Giri Docker container** — a separate container that builds and tests Giri against a specific LLVM version. Paths prefixed with `/giri/` exist **only inside this container**.

**Never run tests from the devcontainer.** Build and test Giri by running a Giri Docker container, then iterating inside it:

```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .         # full image build (includes LLVM toolchain)
docker run -it --rm <image-name> bash  # iterate inside container
```

Inside the running container:

```bash
source /giri/utils/build.sh   # rebuilds modified parts and runs tests
```

Build output is flat: `build/lib` (`libgiri.so`, `libdgutility.so`, `librtgiri.a`) and `build/bin` (`tracer`, `prtrace`).

For detailed build, test, and debugging commands inside the Giri container, see `porting/AgentGuide.md`.

## Picking up work

Tasks live in `porting/TaskNotes/Tasks/`. Use the `handle-task` skill to:

1. Read the task note
2. Resolve repo/backend/branch with `driver.py resolve`
3. Plan, implement, push, open an MR/PR
4. Finish with `driver.py finish`

Credentials are loaded by the devcontainer from `.env` (gitignored). `driver.py` reads them from environment variables — **you do not need to source `.env` manually** inside the devcontainer. See `.devcontainer/open-code/.env.example` for the expected variable names.

If the target `port/llvm-X` branch doesn't exist, create it from `master` before starting work. See `porting/README.md` for the branch structure.

## Code layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lib/Giri/TracingNoGiri.cpp` | Instrumentation pass |
| `lib/Giri/Giri.cpp` | Backward-slice computation |
| `lib/Giri/TraceFile.cpp` | (~1500 lines) Trace parser, most subtle file |
| `include/Giri/Runtime.h` | `Entry` struct (trace record format) — ABI boundary |
| `runtime/Giri/Tracing.cpp` | `librtgiri` — C++/pthreads, **no LLVM dependency** |
| `lib/Utility/BasicBlockNumbering.cpp` | BB numbering |
| `lib/Utility/LoadStoreNumbering.cpp` | Load/store numbering |
| `lib/Utility/PostDominatorFrontier.cpp` | Post-dominance frontier |
| `lib/Utility/SourceLineMapping.cpp` | Debug-info -> `file:line` mapping |

## Critical invariants

Three invariants must be preserved during any port. Read the canonical description in `porting/HowItWorks.md` — "Key invariants a port must preserve":

1. **Numbering determinism** — `-bbnum`/`-lsnum` must assign identical IDs in both instrumentation and slicing runs.
2. **`Entry` struct ABI** — `Runtime.h` layout and size-divides-page-size invariant must not change.
3. **Debug info** — `-g` is mandatory; `SourceLineMapping` depends on it.

## Code conventions

- LLVM 3.4-vintage C++ — old pass manager, `OwningPtr` in places, no range-for rewrites.
- Pre-existing filename inconsistency: `include/Utility/PostDominanceFrontier.h` vs `lib/Utility/PostDominatorFrontier.cpp` — not a typo.
